### GET and POST request using Python
"""
This post discusses two HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request methods  GET and POST requests in Python and their implementation in python.

What is HTTP?
HTTP is a set of protocols designed to enable communication between clients and servers. It works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.
A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.

So, to request a response from the server, there are mainly two methods:

GET : to request data from the server.
POST : to submit data to be processed to the server.

## Making a GET request

# importing the requests library 
import requests 
  
# api-endpoint 
URL = "http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json"
  
# location given here 
location = "delhi technological university"
  
# defining a params dict for the parameters to be sent to the API 
PARAMS = {'address':location} 
  
# sending get request and saving the response as response object 
r = requests.get(url = URL, params = PARAMS) 
  
# extracting data in json format 
data = r.json() 
  
  
# extracting latitude, longitude and formatted address  
# of the first matching location 
latitude = data['results'][0]['geometry']['location']['lat'] 
longitude = data['results'][0]['geometry']['location']['lng'] 
formatted_address = data['results'][0]['formatted_address'] 
  
# printing the output 
print("Latitude:%s\nLongitude:%s\nFormatted Address:%s"
      %(latitude, longitude,formatted_address)) 



### Making a POST request

# importing the requests library 
import requests 
  
# defining the api-endpoint  
API_ENDPOINT = "http://pastebin.com/api/api_post.php"
  
# your API key here 
API_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  
# your source code here 
source_code = ''' 
print("Hello, world!") 
a = 1 
b = 2 
print(a + b) 
'''
  
# data to be sent to api 
data = {'api_dev_key':API_KEY, 
        'api_option':'paste', 
        'api_paste_code':source_code, 
        'api_paste_format':'python'} 
  
# sending post request and saving response as response object 
r = requests.post(url = API_ENDPOINT, data = data) 
  
# extracting response text  
pastebin_url = r.text 
print("The pastebin URL is:%s"%pastebin_url)
